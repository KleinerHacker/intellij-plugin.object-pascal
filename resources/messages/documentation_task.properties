The task listed before the child task with a level of 1 less than the child task, is the parent task. Other tasks with the same parent task as the child task are sibling tasks.</p>\
                                         <p>A child task can't be selected if its parent task isn't selected. A parent task can't be selected if none of its children are selected, unless a <tt>Tasks</tt> parameter directly references the parent task or the parent task includes the <tt>checkablealone</tt> flag.</p>\
                                         <p>If sibling tasks have the <tt>exclusive</tt> flag, only one of them can be selected.</p>\

property.flags=This parameter is a set of extra options. Multiple options may be used by separating them by spaces.

# Flags
flags.checkablealone=<p>Specifies that the task can be checked when none of its children are. By default, if no <tt>Tasks</tt> parameter directly references the task, unchecking all of the task's children will cause the task to become unchecked.</p>
flags.checkedonce=<p>Instructs Setup that this task should be unchecked initially when Setup finds a previous version of the <a href="topic_sameappnotes.htm">same application</a> is already installed.</p>\
                        <p>If the <tt>UsePreviousTasks [Setup]</tt> section directive is <tt>no</tt>, this flag is effectively disabled.</p>
flags.dontinheritcheck=<p>Specifies that the task should not automatically become checked when its parent is checked. Has no effect on top-level tasks, and cannot be combined with the <tt>exclusive</tt> flag.</p>
flags.exclusive=<p>Instructs Setup that this task is mutually exclusive with sibling tasks that also have the <tt>exclusive</tt> flag.</p>
flags.restart=<p>Instructs Setup to ask the user to restart the system at the end of installation if this task is selected, regardless of whether it is necessary (for example because of [Files] section entries with the <tt>restartreplace</tt> flag). Like <a href="topic_setup_alwaysrestart.htm">AlwaysRestart</a> but per task.</p>
flags.unchecked=<p>Instructs Setup that this task should be unchecked initially.</p>
