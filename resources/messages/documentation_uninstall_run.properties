# Properties
property.filename=<b>Required</b><br/><p>The program to execute, or file/folder to open. If <tt>Filename</tt> is not an executable (.exe or .com) or batch file (.bat or .cmd), you <i>must</i> use the <tt>shellexec</tt> flag on the entry. This parameter can include constants.</p>
property.parameters=<p>Optional command line parameters for the program, which can include constants.</p>
property.workingdir=<p>The initial current directory for the program. If this parameter is not specified or is blank, it uses the directory from the <tt>Filename</tt> parameter; if <tt>Filename</tt> does not include a path, it will use a default directory. This parameter can include constants.</p>
property.runonceid=<p>Valid only in an <tt>[UninstallRun]</tt> section. If the same application is installed more than once, "run" entries will be duplicated in the uninstall log file. By assigning a string to <tt>RunOnceId</tt>, you can ensure that a particular <tt>[UninstallRun]</tt> entry will only be executed once during uninstallation. For example, if two or more "run" entries in the uninstall log have a <tt>RunOnceId</tt> setting of "DelService", only the latest entry with a <tt>RunOnceId</tt> setting of "DelService" will be executed; the rest will be ignored. Note that <tt>RunOnceId</tt> comparisons are case-sensitive.</p>
property.verb=<p>Specifies the action to be performed on the file. Must be combined with the <tt>shellexec</tt> flag. Commonly available verbs include "open" and "print". If this parameter is not specified or is blank, the default verb for the file type will be used (typically "open").</p>
property.flags=<p>This parameter is a set of extra options. Multiple options may be used by separating them by spaces</p>

# Flags
flags.32bit=<p>Causes the <tt>{sys}</tt> constant to map to the 32-bit System directory when used in the <tt>Filename</tt> and <tt>WorkingDir</tt> parameters. This is the default behavior in a <a href="topic_32vs64bitinstalls.htm">32-bit mode</a> install.</p>\
               <p>This flag cannot be combined with the <tt>shellexec</tt> flag.</p>
flags.64bit=<p>Causes the <tt>{sys}</tt> constant to map to the 64-bit System directory when used in the <tt>Filename</tt> and <tt>WorkingDir</tt> parameters. This is the default behavior in a <a href="topic_32vs64bitinstalls.htm">64-bit mode</a> install.</p>\
               <p>This flag can only be used when Setup is running on 64-bit Windows, otherwise an error will occur. On an installation supporting both 32- and 64-bit architectures, it is possible to avoid the error by adding a <tt>Check: IsWin64</tt> parameter, which will cause the entry to be silently skipped when running on 32-bit Windows.</p>\
               <p>This flag cannot be combined with the <tt>shellexec</tt> flag.</p>
flags.hidewizard=<p>If this flag is specified, the wizard will be hidden while the program is running.</p>
flags.nowait=<p>If this flag is specified, it will not wait for the process to finish executing before proceeding to the next [Run] entry, or completing Setup. Cannot be combined with <tt>waituntilidle</tt> or <tt>waituntilterminated</tt>.</p>
flags.runascurrentuser=<p>If this flag is specified, the spawned process will inherit Setup/Uninstall's user credentials (typically, full administrative privileges).</p>\
                          <p>This is the default behavior when the <tt>postinstall</tt> flag is not used.</p>\
                          <p>This flag cannot be combined with the <tt>runasoriginaluser</tt> flag.</p>
flags.runhidden=<p>If this flag is specified, it will launch the program in a hidden window. Never use this flag when executing a program that may prompt for user input.</p>
flags.runmaximized=<p>If this flag is specified, it will launch the program or document in a maximized window.</p>
flags.runminimized=<p>If this flag is specified, it will launch the program or document in a minimized window.</p>
flags.shellexec=<p>This flag is required if <tt>Filename</tt> is not a directly executable file (an .exe or .com file). When this flag is set, <tt>Filename</tt> can be a folder or any registered file type -- including .chm, .doc, and so on. The file will be opened with the application associated with the file type on the user's system, the same way it would be if the user double-clicked the file in Explorer.</p>\
                   <p>By default, when the <tt>shellexec</tt> flag is used it will not wait until the spawned process terminates. If you need that, you must add the flag <tt>waituntilterminated</tt>. Note that it cannot and will not wait if a new process isn't spawned -- for example, if <tt>Filename</tt> specifies a folder.</p>
flags.skipifdoesntexist=<p>If this flag is specified in the [Run] section, Setup won't display an error message if <tt>Filename</tt> doesn't exist.</p>\
                           <p>If this flag is specified in the [UninstallRun] section, the uninstaller won't display the "some elements could not be removed" warning if <tt>Filename</tt> doesn't exist.</p>\
                           <p>When this flag is used, <tt>Filename</tt> must be an absolute path.</p>
flags.waituntilidle=<p>If this flag is specified, it will wait until the process has completely terminated. Note that this is the default behavior (i.e. you don't need to specify this flag) unless you're using <tt>shellexec</tt> flag, in which case you do need to specify this flag if you want it to wait. Cannot be combined with <tt>nowait</tt> or <tt>waituntilidle</tt>.</p>
