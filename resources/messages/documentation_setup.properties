# Properties
property.appname=<p>This required directive specifies the name of the application being installed. Do not include the version number, as that is defined by the <a href="topic_setup_appversion.htm">AppVersion</a> and/or <a href="topic_setup_appvername.htm">AppVerName</a> directives. <tt>AppName</tt> is displayed throughout the Setup program and uninstaller in window titles, wizard pages, and dialog boxes. The value may include constants.</p>\
                       <p>The value of this directive is also used as the default value for the <a href="topic_setup_appid.htm">AppId</a>, <a href="topic_setup_versioninfodescription.htm">VersionInfoDescription</a>, and <a href="topic_setup_versioninfoproductname.htm">VersionInfoProductName</a> directives if those are not specified.</p>
property.appversion=<p>This directive specifies the version number of the application being installed. The value of this directive, which may include constants, is used in the default value for the <a href="topic_setup_appvername.htm">AppVerName</a> directive, and is displayed in the Version field of the application's <i>Add/Remove Programs</i> entry. It is also used to set the <tt>MajorVersion</tt> and <tt>MinorVersion</tt> values in the Uninstall registry key when possible.</p>\
                          <p>This directive is required and cannot be empty if the <a href="topic_setup_appvername.htm">AppVerName</a> directive is not set.</p>
property.compression=<p>This specifies the method of compression to use on the files, and optionally the level of compression. Higher levels compress better but take longer doing so, and may also require more memory while compressing/decompressing.</p><br/>\
                           <p><tt>zip</tt> is the method of compression employed by .zip files ("deflate"). It is fast in both compression and decompression, and has very low memory requirements (less than 1 MB for both compression and decompression at level 9), but generally does not compress nearly as well as the other supported methods. <tt>zip</tt>, like <tt>lzma2</tt>, has one special property, though: it will not expand uncompressible data (e.g., files that are already compressed). If a compression level isn't specified, it defaults to 7.</p>\
                           <p><tt>bzip</tt> is the method of compression employed by the <a href="http://www.bzip.org/" target="_blank" title="http://www.bzip.org/">bzip2</a> compressor. It almost always compresses better than <tt>zip</tt> but is usually slower in both compression and decompression. Up to 4 MB of memory is required during decompression, and up to 8 MB during compression. If a compression level isn't specified, it defaults to 9.</p>\
                           <p><tt>lzma</tt> is the method of compression employed by the <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" title="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip LZMA</a> compressor. It typically compresses significantly better than the <tt>zip</tt> and <tt>bzip</tt> methods. However, depending on the compression level used, it can be significantly slower at compressing, and consume a <i>lot</i> more memory. The following table summarizes the approximate memory requirements for each of the supported <tt>lzma</tt> compression levels. If a compression level isn't specified, it defaults to <tt>max</tt>.</p>\

                           <p><tt>lzma2</tt> is the method of compression employed by the <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" title="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip LZMA2</a> compressor. LZMA2 is a modified version of LZMA that offers a better compression ratio for uncompressible data (random data expands about 0.005%, compared to 1.35% with original LZMA), and optionally can compress multiple parts of large files in parallel, greatly increasing compression speed but with a possible reduction in compression ratio (see <a href="topic_setup_lzmanumblockthreads.htm">LZMANumBlockThreads</a>). Like LZMA, it can consume a <i>lot</i> of memory; see the above table. If a compression level isn't specified, it defaults to <tt>max</tt>.</p>\
                           <p><tt>none</tt> specifies that no compression be used.</p>\
