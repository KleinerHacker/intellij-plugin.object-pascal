setup=This section contains global settings used by the installer and uninstaller. Certain directives are required for any installation you create.
types=This section is optional. It defines all of the setup types Setup will show on the Select Components page of the wizard. During compilation a set of default setup types is created if you define components in a [Components] section but don't define types.
components=This section is optional. It defines all of the components Setup will show on the Select Components page of the wizard for setup type customization.
tasks=This section is optional. It defines all of the user-customizable tasks Setup will perform during installation. These tasks appear as check boxes and radio buttons on the Select Additional Tasks wizard page.
dirs=This optional section defines any additional directories Setup is to create besides the application directory the user chooses, which is created automatically. Creating subdirectories underneath the main application directory is a common use for this section.
files=<p>This optional section defines any files Setup is to install on the user's system.</p>\
              <p>Here is an example of a <tt>[Files]</tt> section:</p>\
              <pre class="indent examplebox">\
              [Files]\
              Source: "CTL3DV2.DLL"; DestDir: "{sys}"; Flags: onlyifdoesntexist uninsneveruninstall\
              Source: "MYPROG.EXE"; DestDir: "{app}"\
              Source: "MYPROG.CHM"; DestDir: "{app}"\
              Source: "README.TXT"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: isreadme\
              </pre>\
              <p>See the <i>Remarks</i> section at the bottom of this topic for some important notes.</p>
icons=This optional section defines any shortcuts Setup is to create in the Start Menu and/or other locations, such as the desktop.
ini=This optional section defines any .INI file entries you would like Setup to set on the user's system.
installdelete=This optional section is identical in format to the [UninstallDelete] section, except its entries are processed as the first step of installation.
languages=Inno Setup supports multilingual installations. The [Languages] section defines the languages to make available to the Setup program.<br/>\
                  <br/>\
                  Setup determines the default language to use for its messages in the following order:<br/>\
                  <br/>\
                  Non-Unicode Inno Setup:<br/>\
                  <br/>\
                  It searches for a language whose LanguageID setting (normally specified in the [LangOptions] section of the language's .isl file) matches both the primary language identifier and sublanguage identifier of the current user's UI language or locale (depending on the setting of LanguageDetectionMethod), and whose LanguageCodePage setting matches the system code page.<br/>\
                  If no match is found, it searches for just a primary language identifier and code page match. If two or more available languages have the same primary language identifier and code page, it selects the first one listed in the [Languages] section.<br/>\
                  If no match is found, it defaults to the first language specified in the [Languages] section.<br/>\
                  Unicode Inno Setup:<br/>\
                  <br/>\
                  It searches for a language whose LanguageID setting (normally specified in the [LangOptions] section of the language's .isl file) matches both the primary language identifier and sublanguage identifier of the current user's UI language or locale (depending on the setting of LanguageDetectionMethod).<br/>\
                  If no match is found, it searches for just a primary language identifier match. If two or more available languages have the same primary language identifier, it selects the first one listed in the [Languages] section.<br/>\
                  Exception: Simplified Chinese is excluded from consideration in this step if the user's UI language or locale (depending on the setting of LanguageDetectionMethod) is Traditional Chinese, and vice versa.<br/>\
                  If no match is found, it defaults to the first language specified in the [Languages] section.<br/>\
                  If the ShowLanguageDialog [Setup] section directive is set to yes (the default), a Select Language dialog will be displayed which gives the user an opportunity to override the language Setup chose. On non Unicode Inno Setup languages that can't be displayed properly on the user's system will be hidden. See the [LangOptions] section help topic for details.<br/>
messages=A [Messages] section is used to define the messages displayed by the Setup program and uninstaller. Normally, you need not create a [Messages] section in your script file, since all messages are, by default, pulled in from the file Default.isl included with Inno Setup (or whichever file is specified by a [Languages] section entry).
custommessages=A [CustomMessages] section is used to define the custom message values for {cm:...} constants. See the Constants documentation for more information.
langoptions=A [LangOptions] section is used to define the language-specific settings, such as fonts, used by the Setup program and uninstaller. Normally, you need not create a [LangOptions] section in your script file, since the language-specific settings are, by default, pulled in from the file Default.isl included with Inno Setup (or whichever file is specified by a [Languages] section entry).
registry=This optional section defines any registry keys/values you would like Setup to create, modify, or delete on the user's system.
run=The [Run] section is optional, and specifies any number of programs to execute after the program has been successfully installed, but before the Setup program displays the final dialog. The [UninstallRun] section is optional as well, and specifies any number of programs to execute as the first step of uninstallation. Both sections share an identical syntax, except where otherwise noted below.
uninstalldelete=This optional section defines any additional files or directories you want the uninstaller to delete, besides those that were installed/created using [Files] or [Dirs] section entries. Deleting .INI files created by your application is one common use for this section. The uninstaller processes these entries as the last step of uninstallation.
uninstallrun=The [Run] section is optional, and specifies any number of programs to execute after the program has been successfully installed, but before the Setup program displays the final dialog. The [UninstallRun] section is optional as well, and specifies any number of programs to execute as the first step of uninstallation. Both sections share an identical syntax, except where otherwise noted below.<br/>\
                      <br/>\
                      Programs are executed in the order they appear in the script. By default, when processing a [Run]/[UninstallRun] entry, Setup/Uninstall will wait until the program has terminated before proceeding to the next one, unless the nowait, shellexec, or waituntilidle flags are used.<br/>\
                      <br/>\
                      Note that by default, if a program executed in the [Run] section queues files to be replaced on the next reboot (by calling MoveFileEx or by modifying wininit.ini), Setup will detect this and prompt the user to restart the computer at the end of installation. If you don't want this, set the RestartIfNeededByRun directive to no.<br/>
